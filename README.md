# DailyKanji

## About

This program displays a random Kanji each day from a set list in xml.
you can run it on an old computer, a raspberry pi or a phone to get daily exposure to new Kanjis to help you learn them!

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
